# Face Anonymizer For Dataset Building with TF2


![TensorFlow Version: 2.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tensorflow%20Version-2.2-brightgreen)


Many tasks in computer vision require Images Taken in the wild (ie. Road, festival, Events, etc. ), but building a Dataset for Human behavior related task wan be tricky. GDPR does not allow storage of pictures taken without consent, that's normal you might say ! 
It would be a shame to limit AI application due to GDPR right ? At Picsellia, we are dedicated to help people build better CV models, so that was kind of obvious for us to build an anonymizer that could help you build GDPR-Compliant  Human-related Dataset !

## Getting Started
